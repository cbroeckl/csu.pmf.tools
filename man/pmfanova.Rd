}
\arguments{
\item{ramclustObj}{ramclustR object to perform ANOVA on}

\item{anova.name}{character; optionally assign a name to the anova. valuable if you wish to perform more than one ANOVA on a sample set. If NULL, name will be autogenerated from the anova.call and subset information.}

\item{which.data}{character; which dataset (SpecAbund or SpecAbundAve) to perform PCA on.}

\item{subset}{character vector; must be even length.  If you wish to perform ANOVA only when your factor called 'treatment' is a 'trt' sample and when 'time' is '3', then you would use is i.e. c("treatment", "trt", "time", "3"). vector length must always be even, and with 'factor' followed by 'level'.}

\item{anova.call}{charachter;  the model you wish to run.  i.e. "Trt * Time" or "Trt * Time + (1|Block)"}

\item{posthoc}{character; if you wish to perform post hoc testing, define the posthoc test to use.  i.e. if anova.call is "Trt * Time" you can use "Trt|Time" to specific 'treatment within time' comparisons.}

\item{effectsplots}{logical; if TRUE, plot effect plots in pdf format.  If plotting fails, can set to 'FALSE' to get tabular results only.}

\item{delim}{character; what is the character delimiting factors in the sample names.  generally '-'}

\item{plots}{logical; if plotting is any issue set this to FALSE.}

\item{pcut}{numeric; what is the pvalue cutoff for determining significance?  Used only for plotting.}

\item{p.adj}{character; what p.adjust method should be used.  generally 'fdr' or 'bh' (equivalent). see ?p.adjust}

\item{which.quan;}{chracter vector.  which factors should be interpreted as quantitative?  i.e. c("time", "dose")}
}
\value{
returns a ramclustR object.  new R object in $pca slot. Optionally, new R object in $AuerGervini slot if npc = "auto".
}
\description{
