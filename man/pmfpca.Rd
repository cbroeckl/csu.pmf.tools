pmfpca(
  ramclustObj = RC,
  which.data = "SpecAbund",
  scale = "pareto",
  which.factors = NULL,
  num.factors = NULL,
  label.by = "ann",

\arguments{
\item{ramclustObj}{ramclustR object to perform PCA on}

\item{which.data}{character; which dataset (SpecAbund or SpecAbundAve) to perform PCA on.}

\item{scale}{character; default = 'pareto'.  will also accept 'uv' or 'none'}

\item{which.factors}{character vector; i.e. which.factors = c("treatment", "time").   which factors should be used for coloring PCA plots?}

\item{num.factors}{which factors should be treated as numeric? must be subset of 'which.factors'. i.e. c("time")}

\item{label.by}{how should metabolites columns be labelled? one of 'ann' or 'cmpd', typically.}

\item{npc}{"auto" by default (recommended).  This will autoselect number of PCs to use.  Can also be set to any integer value to force more PCs.}
}
\value{
returns a ramclustR object.  new R object in $pca slot. Optionally, new R object in $AuerGervini slot if npc = "auto".
}
\description{
perform principle compponent analysis on ramclustR object dataset, export plots
}
\details{
This function uses the native prcomp() function in R to perform PCA analysis.

Automatic selection of the number of principle components using the AuerGervini method is enabled by the PCDimension and ClassDiscovery packages.

R PCA AuerGervini objects are attached to the ramclustR object, and summary plots and csv files are written to the stats/pca directory in the working directory

a methods narrative is also appended to the $history slot
